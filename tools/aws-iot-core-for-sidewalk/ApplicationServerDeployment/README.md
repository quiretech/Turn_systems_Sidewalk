# Amazon Sidewalk Sample IoT App - Grafana dashboard

`deploy_grafana.py` enables you to create an AWS Grafana workspace to visualize incoming uplinks and notifications.

### Additional prerequisties

- AWS account with IAM Identity Center enabled: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-started-enable-identity-center.html

### Grafana workspace

SidewalkGrafanaStack provides the data visualization via Grafana dashboard. 
Dashboard reads the data stored in *Notifications* and *UplinkMessages* tables 
and displays information in a single view with different widgets. 
Whenever new uplink or notification appears, it is visible on the dashboard. You can filter the data using *wireless_device_id* variable.

Access to the dashboard is restricted to the users created in IAM Identity Center and assigned to the Amazon Grafana 
workspace.

### Cloud infrastructure

SidewalkGrafana stack works independently of the Sensor Monitoring Application stack.
It forwards incoming messages to two tables in the *SidewalkTimestream* database:
- *UplinkMessages* - which stores payload of the incoming uplink messages
- *Notifications* - which stores incoming notifications

It also provides a Grafana dashboard for tracing incoming messages.
Mentioned tables are datasource for the dashboard.

Components of the SidewalkGrafana stack are depicted by the diagram below.
Components are connected by arrows, which represent dataflow. Color denotes message type:
- green --> *uplink*
- blue --> *notification*
- red --> *error*

|---|
| *SidewalkGrafana  - resources and dataflow* |

*SidewalkGrafanaStack* CloudFormation stack provides resources that handle messages coming from Sidewalk-enabled devices.
It also creates necessary roles and permissions, not included on the diagram. 
Its main components are:

- *SIDEWALK_DESTINATION* - maps a device message to the MQTT topic.
  Each Sidewalk device need to have its destination defined, so that AWS IoT knows where to redirect the message.
  You can change destination of your device using *UpdateDestination* method from the AWS IoT Wireless API.
  All the uplink messages from the *SIDEWALK_DESTINATION* are redirected to the *sidewalk/app_data* topic.


- *GrafanaUplinkRule* - receives uplink messages from the sidewalk/app_data topic. 
  It forwards incoming uplinks to the  *UplinkMessages* table. 
  In case of error, error messages are stored in the *GrafanaRuleError* log group.


- *GrafanaNotificationRule* - receives event notifications for Sidewalk resources.
  It forwards incoming notifications to the *Notifications* table
  In case of error, error messages are stored in the *GrafanaRuleError* log group.
  

- *UplinkMessages* - stores uplink messages
  

- *Notifications* - stores notifications

### Stack deployment

|WARNING: You will be billed for the usage of AWS resources created by this application. 
|---
| In particular, you will be charged for every active user of the Grafana dashboard. Keep in mind that every deployment creates an API key needed to setup the dashboard and data sources, each is counted as a single user with admin permissions.
| Amazon Timestream bills you for the amount of data written to / read from the tables. Frequent data reads can significantly increase the cost of using this database. Please keep this in mind while setting auto-refresh interval for Grafana dashboard.

1. Update the [config_grafana](./config_grafana.yaml) if needed:  

    - *IDENTITY_STORE_ID* - The globally unique identifier for the identity store, such as d-1234567890.   
      This value can be read from the IAM Identity Center -> Settings view.  
      If you want the script to create Grafana workspace users for you, you need to specify this value.
      
      | ![Alt text](./doc/identity_store_id.png "Identity Center view") |
      |---|
      | *Identity store ID can be read from the IAM Identity Center -> Settings view* |
    
    - *IDENTITY_CENTER_USERS* - list of users to be created in the identity store and grouped into the 
      *SidewalkGrafanaApplicationUsers* group.  
      By default, script creates a single user - *GrafanaUser*. 
      Each user must be described with the following mandatory fields:
        - *USER_NAME* -  user's unique identifier
        - *FIRST_NAME* - user's first name
        - *LAST_NAME* - user's last name
          
        If you want the script to create Grafana workspace users for you, you need to specify this value.
    
    
2. Create SidewalkGrafana stack and Grafana workspace using the *deploy_grafana.py* script:
   ```
   python3 ApplicationServerDeployment/deploy_grafana.py
   ```
   
3. Assign users to the Grafana workspace.  
   Log into your AWS account, navigate to the *AmazonGrafana* and click *All workspaces*.  
   Select *SidewalkGrafanaWorkspace* and then *Assign new user or group*. 
   
   | ![Alt text](./doc/grafana_workspace.png "Grafana - SidewalkGrafanaWorkspace") |
   |---|
   | *Grafana - SidewalkGrafanaWorkspace* |
   
   Switch to the *Groups* tab.   
   Select *SidewalkGrafanaApplicationUsers* group.
   All users created by the *deploy_grafana.py* belong to this group.  
   Click *Assign users and groups*.
   *SidewalkGrafanaApplicationUsers* will be assigned to the workspace with *Viewer* permissions.

   | ![Alt text](./doc/grafana_assign_group.png "Grafana - Assign group to the workspace") |
   |---|
   | *Grafana - Assign group to the workspace* |

4. Create One-time password for your user.  
   Navigate to the IAM Identity Center and click on the name of the user you want to use to log in 
   (it should be a member of *SidewalkGrafanaApplicationUsers*).
   
   | ![Alt text](./doc/identity_center_users.png "Identity center - Users") |
   |---|
   | *Identity center - Users* |

   Click on *Reset password*.
   
   | ![Alt text](./doc/identity_center_user.png "Identity center - User") |
   |---|
   | *Identity center - particular user panel* |

   Select the *Generate a one-time password and share the password with the user* option. Click *Reset password*.

   | ![Alt text](./doc/identity_center_generate_otp.png "Identity center - generate one-time password") |
   |---|
   | *Generate one-time password panel* |

    Record the One-time password for the created user.
   
    | ![Alt text](./doc/identity_center_otp.png "One-time password") |
    |---|
    | *One-time password panel* |


5. Navigate to the Grafana dashboard using address provided by the *deploy_grafana.py* script 
   (it is also stored in the *config_grafana.yaml* under *WORKSPACE_URL* and accessible via Amazon Grafana console).  
   Log in using One-time password configured in the previous step.
   
   | ![Alt text](./doc/grafana_sign_in.png "Grafana dashboard - sign in page") |
   |---|
   | *Grafana dashboard - sign in page* |
   
   After logging in, you should be able to see the SidewalkGrafanaApplication dashboard. 
   Send an uplink message from your device and refresh the dashboard, to confirm that it was successfully received by 
   the deployed infrastructure.
   

### Stack Deletion

Deletion of the stack and grafana workspace can be done automatically (using the *delete_grafana.py*) or manually (from the AWS console).  
IAM Identity Center users (read from the [config_grafana](./config_grafana.yaml)), may or may not be deleted depending on the user input.

 - OPTION A - automatically using script
        ```
        python3 ApplicationServerDeployment/delete_grafana.py
        ```
 - OPTION B - manually from the AWS console  
   Go to the AWS console, select the resource, and click delete.
    - CloudFormation: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks
    - Grafana: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/grafana/home?region=us-east-1#/workspaces
